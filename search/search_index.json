This document was developed to eliminate confusion regarding ACES component names from both engineering and user perspectives. Introduction \u00b6 ACES component names have technical names that emerged from the engineering and development process. While the names make sense to the scientists, engineers and early adopters that \u201cgrew up\u201d with the system, the larger adoption community targeted for adoption by ACES Version 1.0 does not have the historical knowledge and context of the ACES pioneers and a large majority of that community does not have the technical training needed to understand many of the existing names. This Technical Bulletin documents the ACES component naming conventions as agreed to by the ACES Project Committee for the ACES 1.0 System Release. Scope \u00b6 This Technical Bulletin document ACES Version 1.0 component names. These names were settled on after extensive discussions at ACES Project Committee meetings, feedback from the field, internal discussions amongst the ACES Leadership Team and the work of the ACES User Experience Working Group. The names documented herein rationalize naming approaches between diverse technical components, are technically correct, sensible for end users, acknowledge terminology that seems to have \u201cstuck\u201d and accommodate system evolution. Words instead of acronyms are used where possible, and the ACES prefix was liberally used to promote a system identity.

ACES User-facing Components \u00b6 Encodings \u00b6 There are four image encodings that are used in ACES projects, although all encodings are not used in all workflows. The approach taken here is to keep the ACES prefix to identify the encodings as ACES components. Pre-release nomenclature: SMPTE 2065-1:2012, a.k.a. \u201c ACES \u201d Use: base encoding, used for exchange of full fidelity images, archiving ACES 1.0 name: \u201cACES2065-1\u201d Pre-release nomenclature: \u201c ACES wire format\u201d, a.k.a. \u201cACESproxy,\u201d \u201cACESproxy10,\u201d \u201cACESproxy12\u201d Use: lightweight encoding for transmission over HD-SDI (or other production transmission schemes), on-set look management.
